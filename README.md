# LLM Project: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

This project implements sentiment analysis on the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset using the pre-trained transformer model, **BERT**. The model classifies customer reviews as either positive or negative. The project includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and inference, offering an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuning language models on sentiment analysis tasks.
